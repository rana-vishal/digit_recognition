# Nearest neighbor for handwritten digit recognition

In this notebook we will build a classifier that takes an image of a handwritten digit and outputs a label 0-9. We will look at a particularly simple strategy for this problem known as the nearest neighbor classifier.
In this notebook we will be working with dataset containing: a training set of 7,500 examples and a test set of 1,000 examples.
